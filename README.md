# Get started
Make a local copy of the repo

`git clone https://github.com/elysiumdelivery/altare-tcg.git`

Inside the created folder, run the following to install dependencies. (Currently this is just Prettier, so if you skip this step, the app will load locally, but you just won't get auto-formatting.)

`npm install`

To view the app locally, open `index.html` in your browser, and refresh each time you make a code change.
